## Setup Instructions

### Frontend Setup
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev
```

### Backend Setup (Required for Export Functionality)

To enable video export, you need to run the backend server:

1. **Clone the backend repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Abenaitwe/vidcamp-backend
   cd vidcamp-backend
   ```

2. **Install Python dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Install FFMPEG:**
   - **MacOS:** `brew install ffmpeg`
   - **Ubuntu/Debian:** `sudo apt-get install ffmpeg`
   - **Windows:** Download from [ffmpeg.org](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html)

4. **Run the backend server:**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   # or
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```
   
   The server should start on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`

5. **Configure the backend URL (Optional):**
   - Copy `.env.local.example` to `.env.local`
   - Update `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL` if your backend runs on a different port

### Using the Export Feature

1. Create your video composition
2. Click the Export button in the left panel
3. Wait for processing (can take 15-30 seconds depending on video length)
4. Your video will download automatically as `final_video.mp4`
